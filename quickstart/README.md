A run through the [quickstart tutorial](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_TutorialQuickstart.html).

Learning Notes
==============

* GAMS is case-insensitive
* See `example1-documented.gms` for example of muti-line comments and explanatory text
* Single-line comments can be made by starting a line with an asterisk `*`.
* Best practice is to end every statement with a semicolon `;`, but these are optional if the next statement starts with a keyword and is after a line break.
* Everything needs to be declared and defined before being used.
* See the [good practices](https://www.gams.com/latest/docs/UG_GoodPractices.html) tutorial for further tips.
